## Map object

### A map object holds a key-value pair, which the key can be of any datatype. A map remembers the original insertion order of the keys, and can easily be iterated over, a map should be used instead of an object where iteration, and order is needed. Play around map in [javascript](./script.js) to get a better understanding. When you are done reading, and playing with this, you can ask chatgpt to question you on it, and learn more.
